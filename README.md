Refrehable braille display using micro-vibration motors

Of 40 million blind people in the world, only 10% can read and write braille. 
One of the primary reason for this is because braille hasn't yet found its footing in the digital era,
due to the sheer cost of such devices, as well as the affordability matrix of the visually impaired. 

Low-cost braille displays have been sought after for quite a while with no avail. 
Commercially available braille displays employ peizo-electric actuated pins, which are very expensive. 

Due to the sheer expense of braille technology, and the scarce availability of books in braille, the medium is slowly falling out
of favour. But many agree that braille literacy is paramount for the empowerment of the blind for education and employment. 

The display would be used along with https://hackaday.io/project/10745-brailler-style-keyboard to make a full modular braille computer
